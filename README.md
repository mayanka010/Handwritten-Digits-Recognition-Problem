# Handwritten-Images-Recognition-Problem
A Machine Learning project (particularly a classification problem). The dataset consists pixels of digits which I have used to predict the digit using various algorithms. I have used KNN, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Artificial Neural Networks(Multi Layer Perceptron).
